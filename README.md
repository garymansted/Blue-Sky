# Blue-Sky
Small app for a coding challenge in SWIFT 4 EDIT: Updated to Swift 5

## Release Notes:


If you want to pull it and use it you'll need to get and change a couple of keys in the apps config file. The keys you need are: an IOS Google Maps API key (Google Developers Console) & an Open Weather Maps API key (https://openweathermap.org/api).
