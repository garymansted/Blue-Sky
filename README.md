# Blue-Sky
Small app for a coding challenge (SWIFT 4)

Release Notes:


If you want to pull it and use it you'll need to get and change a couple of keys in the apps config file. The keys you need are: an IOS Google Maps API key (Google Developers Console) & an Open Weather Maps API key (https://openweathermap.org/api)

Check out the 'Coding Assignment' PDF for functionality specifics.
